# Assignment

Three branches called `feature-1`, `feature-2` and `feature-3` share a common ancestor `master`.
Merge all three branches to `master`. You'll have to deal with merge conflicts. It should be clear
how to resolve them.

Remove the branches afterwards.

```text

        -- feature-1
       /
master --- feature-2
       \
        -- feature-3
```
