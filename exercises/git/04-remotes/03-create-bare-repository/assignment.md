# Assignment

A *bare* repository is one without working or staging area.
It is not meant to be worked with directly, but instead
act as a remote repo where you push and pull from.

For this exercise, it is our intention to have a
local and remote repository, both stored on your drive.

Under `sandbox`, initialize a new (regular) repository in a directory called `local`.
Also create a new *bare* repository in a directory called `remote`.
