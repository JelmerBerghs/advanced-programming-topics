# Overview

Proceed as follows to solve the exercises:

* Enter the exercise directory in a shell.
* Run `source setup.sh`. This script sets up the git repositories required for the exercise. All files will reside under the directory named `sandbox`.
* Read the assignment.
* Go inside `sandbox` and perform the necessary steps.
* Back outside `sandbox`, run `source verify.sh`. This script checks whether you satisfy the conditions demanded by the exercise. Note that not all exercises have a verification step.

If things go wrong, you can always rerun `source setup.sh`: it will delete all exercise related files and rebuild them from scratch.
