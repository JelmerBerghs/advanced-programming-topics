# Assignment

The given repository counts 4 commits. Revert the last commit.

Note that there are two ways to achieve this:

* You can remove the last commit from the history. This is rather risky if working in team.
* You can add a new commit that performs the inverse operation of the commit to be undone.

For this exercise, you need to rely on the second method.

Hint: `git revert`.
