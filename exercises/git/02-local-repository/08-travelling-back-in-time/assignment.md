# Assignment

The repository counts four commits.
You wish to go back in time by one commit.
However, you do not want the repository history to be altered in any way:
you merely want the working and staging area to go
back to the state they were in at the time of the third commit.
It must be possible to restore everything to the final commit
without losing any work.

Hint: `git checkout`.
